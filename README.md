Quizzer web app exercise
 @author: Lincoln Adams

INSTRUCTIONS
	
To run the webapp, simply extract this directory, and point your browser to "../quiz/src/client/index.html" 

The source code can be found in "../quiz/src/client/app/" for all javascript files, and in  "../quiz/src/client/public/" for css files.

To compile the code for yourself, point a NPM CLI to the quiz folder and run "npm install" followed by "npm run start" which will start webpack.
